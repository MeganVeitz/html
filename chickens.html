        Originally raised for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockfight">cockfighting</a> or for special

        "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] However, thanks to its
        usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in
        American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl' or
        'domestic fowl'.[20]
    </p>
    <p>
        'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[21]
