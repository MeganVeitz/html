            <hr>
            <p>
                An adult male is a called a 'cock' or 'rooster' (in the United States) and an adult female is called a
                'hen'.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> <sup><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
            </p>
            Other terms are:
            <ul>
                <li>'Biddy:' a newly hatched chicken<sup>[12][13]</sup></li>

                    chicken<sup>[a]</sup>
                </li>
                <li>'Chick:' a young chicken[14]</li>

                <li>'<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockerels">Cockerel</a>:' a young male chicken less than a

                <li>'Pullet:' a young female chicken less than a year old.<sup>[17]</sup> In the poultry industry, a
                    pullet is a
                    sexually
                    immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.<sup>[18]</sup></li>

            <p>
                "Chicken" was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.<sup>[<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items">when?</a>]</sup>
                However, thanks to
                its
                usage on restaurant menus, it has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general,
                especially
                in
                American English. In older sources, 'chicken' as a species were typically referred to as 'common fowl'
                or
                'domestic fowl'.<sup>[20]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                'Chicken' may also mean a 'chick' (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).<sup>[21]</sup>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late
                18th
                century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "<a
                    href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cock">cock</a>",<sup>[22][23][24]</sup> and
                is widely used throughout North America.
                "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night, which is done by both sexes.

            <p>
                Chickens are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore">omnivores</a>.<sup>[25]</sup> In the wild,
                they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds,
                insects and
                even
                animals as large as <a hef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard">lizards</a>, small
                snakes,<sup>[26]</sup> or young <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse">mice</a>.<sup>[27]</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed">breed</a>.<sup>[28]</sup> The world's oldest
                known
                chicken
                was a
                hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records">Guinness World
                    Records</a>.<sup>[29]</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and
                shiny,
                pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter,
                bolder
                colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebright_chicken">Sebright chicken</a>,
                the
                rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be
                made by
                looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and
                in
                certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a
                fleshy
                crest
                on their heads called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_(anatomy)">comb</a>, or cockscomb,
                and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks
                called
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattle_(anatomy)">wattles</a>. Collectively, these and other
                fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caruncle_(bird_anatomy)">caruncles</a>.
                Both
                the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
                A
                'muff'
                or 'beard' is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation">mutation</a> found in several chicken
                breeds which causes extra feathering under the
                chicken's
                face,
                giving the appearance of a beard.
            </p>

            <p>
                Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally
                capable
                of
                flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost).
                Chickens
                may
                occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived
                danger.
